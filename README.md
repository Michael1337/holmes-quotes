# holmes-quotes
A python web application (Flask) that shows random Sherlock Holmes quotes. 99% is written by ChatGPT.

For the design, I asked for some "victorian london" style. The list of quotes was also completely genereated by ChatGPT. And ChatGPT also told me what docker commands I would need, although I had some difficulties fixing an error where "app:app" was not found. But ChatGPT solved that too after some attempts.<br>
I basically only added the CTF flag in case ID == 0 is requested.
